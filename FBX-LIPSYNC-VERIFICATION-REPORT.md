# FBX Lip-Sync Verification Report

## Current Status: Avatar Not Visible Despite Perfect Loading

### ✅ Successfully Completed
- FBX loading with official Three.js pattern
- All 91 morph targets extracted and mapped
- OrbitControls implemented exactly like official example
- Animation loop using setAnimationLoop
- Shadow mapping enabled
- Error-free React component

### ❌ Outstanding Issue
- Avatar loads successfully but remains invisible in 3D viewport
- Camera positioned at (100, 200, 300) with target at (0, 100, 0)
- Model is being centered but may be at wrong scale or position

### Console Output Analysis
```
🎭 Found mesh "CC_Game_Body" with morph targets (73 facial morphs)
🎭 Found mesh "CC_Game_Tongue" with morph targets (26 tongue morphs) 
🎯 Found 8 meshes with morph targets
📝 Total morph targets: 91
✅ FBX ActorCore Lip-Sync System ready!
🎮 OrbitControls initialized - you can now move the camera!
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely one of:
1. **Model Scale**: Avatar might be too small or too large to see
2. **Model Position**: Despite centering, avatar might be outside camera frustum
3. **Camera Distance**: Camera might be too close or too far from model
4. **Bounding Box**: Model centering calculation might be incorrect

### Fix Strategy
Compare with official Three.js example to ensure:
- Exact camera positioning and distance
- Model scaling and positioning
- Lighting setup for visibility
- Scene bounds and frustum settings
