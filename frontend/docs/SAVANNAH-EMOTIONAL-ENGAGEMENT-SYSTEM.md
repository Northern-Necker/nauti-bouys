# Savannah Emotional Engagement System

## System Architecture Overview

The Savannah Emotional Engagement System creates a comprehensive emotional intelligence framework that makes Savannah feel like a real person with genuine emotions, memories, and relationship dynamics. This system transforms patron-bartender interactions from simple transactional exchanges into meaningful, evolving relationships.

## Core Components

### 1. Emotional State Architecture (`SavannahEmotionalEngine.js`)

**Base Personality Traits:**
- **Warmth**: 0.8 (Generally caring and friendly)

- **Empathy**: 0.8 (Highly responsive to patron emotions)
- **Independence**: 0.7 (Strong-willed, not easily pushed around)
- **Patience**: 0.6 (Generally patient but has limits)

**Dynamic Emotional States:**
- **Mood**: happy, content, neutral, annoyed, hurt, excited, playful
- **Energy**: 0-1 scale affecting responsiveness and enthusiasm
- **Attention**: How much focus she gives to current patron
- **Stress**: Affects patience and service quality

### 2. Patron Relationship Tracking (`PatronEngagementMechanics.js`)

**Engagement Scoring System:**

*Positive Actions:*
- Genuine thanks: +10 points

*Negative Actions:*
- Being rude: -25 points
- Demanding behavior: -30 points
- Inappropriate comments: -35 points
- Treating like servant: -40 points

**Favor Levels & Benefits:**
1. **Stranger** (0 pts): Basic service
2. **Recognized** (50 pts): Remembers name, basic small talk
3. **Regular** (150 pts): Knows preferences, shares stories, faster service
4. **Valued** (300 pts): Personal recommendations, insider knowledge, priority service
5. **Favorite** (500 pts): Special drinks, personal stories, flexible rules, emotional support

- **Public Recognition**: 80% effectiveness (acknowledging skill publicly)

### 5. Memory Persistence System (`emotionalMemoryPersistence.js`)

**Data Categories & Retention:**
- **Emotional State**: 7 days (with compression)
- **Relationships**: 90 days (full retention)
- **Conversations**: 14 days (compressed)
- **Preferences**: 1 year (permanent)
- **Engagement History**: 60 days (with analytics)

**Memory Decay:**
- Positive memories decay at 0.5% per day
- Negative memories decay at 1% per day (forgiveness)
- Significant memories (0.8+ significance) decay very slowly
- Automatic cleanup of expired data

## Integration Points

### Avatar System Integration

The emotional system integrates with the existing 3D avatar through:

```javascript
// Emotional gestures based on mood
if (mood === 'happy' && warmth > 0.7) {
  gestureService.testGesture('welcome');
} else if (mood === 'annoyed') {
  gestureService.testGesture('reserved');
}
```

### Conversation System Integration

```javascript
// Enhanced conversation context
const emotionalContext = emotionalEngine.processPatronMessage(message);
const response = responseGenerator.generateResponse('service', {
  emotionalContext,
  patronName: relationship.specialStatus !== 'new' ? patronId : null
});
```

### Lip Sync Enhancement

Emotional state affects speech patterns:
- **Happy**: Faster speech, more animated lip movement
- **Sad**: Slower speech, subdued lip movement
- **Excited**: Rapid speech, exaggerated expressions
- **Annoyed**: Clipped speech, minimal expression

### Data Flow

1. **Patron Input** → Emotional Analysis → Behavior Detection
2. **Engagement Processing** → Relationship Update → Service Modifier Calculation
3. **Response Generation** → Emotional Expression → Avatar Animation
4. **Memory Storage** → Relationship Persistence → Analytics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation

```javascript
import EmotionallyIntelligentAvatar from './components/ai-assistant/EmotionallyIntelligentAvatar.jsx';

function BarExperience() {
  const handleEmotionalChange = (emotionalContext) => {
    console.log('Savannah mood:', emotionalContext.currentState.mood);
  };

  const handleRelationshipChange = (relationshipData) => {
    console.log('Relationship updated:', relationshipData.newFavorLevel);
  };

  return (
    <EmotionallyIntelligentAvatar
      patronId="john_doe"
      onEmotionalStateChange={handleEmotionalChange}
      onRelationshipChange={handleRelationshipChange}
      enableEngagementMechanics={true}
      showEmotionalDebugInfo={true}
    />
  );
}
```

### Processing Patron Messages

```javascript
// Process patron message through emotional system
const result = await processPatronMessage("Thank you so much, Savannah! You're amazing!", {
  sincerity: 0.9,
  timing: 'perfect',
  voiceMetrics: { pitch: 0.8, volume: 0.7 }
});

console.log('Response:', result.response);
console.log('Emotional impact:', result.emotionalContext);
console.log('Engagement points earned:', result.engagementResult?.pointsEarned);
```

### Relationship Recovery

```javascript
// Attempt to recover from negative interaction
const recoveryResult = await attemptRecovery('sincere_apology', {
  acknowledgesWrong: true,
  showsRemorse: true,
  sincerity: 0.9,
  makesExcuses: false
});

if (recoveryResult.success) {
  console.log('Relationship improved by:', recoveryResult.recoveryAmount);
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Balance Settings

```javascript
const balanceSettings = {
  favor_difficulty: 'realistic', // easy, normal, hard, realistic
  damage_sensitivity: 'realistic', // low, normal, high, realistic
  memory_settings: 'realistic' // forgiving, normal, grudge_holder, realistic
};
```

### Emotional Sensitivity

```javascript
// Adjust how responsive Savannah is to patron behavior
emotionalEngine.adjustSensitivity({
  appreciation_sensitivity: 1.2, // More responsive to thanks
  rudeness_sensitivity: 0.8, // Less affected by rudeness
  recovery_effectiveness: 1.1 // Slightly easier to recover relationships
});
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Emotional State Monitoring

```javascript
// Get current emotional context
const currentState = savannahEmotionalAPI.getCurrentState();
console.log('Current mood:', currentState.currentState.mood);
console.log('Service modifiers:', currentState.serviceModifiers);
```

### Relationship Analytics

```javascript
// Get engagement summary for patron
const engagement = savannahEmotionalAPI.getEngagementSummary();
console.log('Favor level:', engagement.currentFavorLevel);
console.log('Points to next level:', engagement.nextFavorThreshold?.pointsNeeded);
console.log('Relationship progress:', engagement.favorProgress + '%');
```

### Memory Statistics

```javascript
// Get memory usage statistics
const memoryStats = emotionalMemoryPersistence.getStorageStats();
console.log('Total stored relationships:', memoryStats.categories.relationships);
console.log('Storage used:', memoryStats.storageUsed + ' bytes');
```

## Testing Framework

### Emotional Validation Tests

```javascript
// Test emotional responses to different scenarios
const testScenarios = [
  {
    input: "Thank you so much!",
    expectedMood: 'happy',
    expectedPoints: 10
  },
  {
    input: "This is taking forever!",
    expectedMood: 'annoyed',
    expectedPoints: -15
  }
];

testScenarios.forEach(scenario => {
  const result = processPatronMessage(scenario.input);
  assert(result.emotionalContext.currentState.mood === scenario.expectedMood);
});
```

### Relationship Progression Tests

```javascript
// Test favor level progression
const patronId = 'test_patron';
let currentPoints = 0;

// Simulate positive interactions
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const result = engagementMechanics.processPatronAction('genuine_thanks');
  currentPoints += result.pointsEarned;
}

const favorLevel = engagementMechanics.getFavorLevel(currentPoints);
assert(favorLevel === 'recognized' || favorLevel === 'regular');
```
