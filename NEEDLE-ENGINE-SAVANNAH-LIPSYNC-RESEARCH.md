# Needle Engine Research Findings

## Critical Discovery About Needle Engine

After researching Needle Engine documentation, I've discovered several important facts that affect our approach:

### What Needle Engine Actually Is

1. **NOT a Unity WebGL Alternative**: Needle Engine is NOT a replacement for Unity WebGL builds. It doesn't use Unity's build pipeline at all.

2. **glTF Export System**: Needle Engine exports Unity scenes to glTF/GLB format, which are then rendered using Three.js in the browser.

3. **Three.js Based**: The runtime engine uses Three.js internally for all rendering and animation.

### The Export Process

1. Add a `Needle Engine` component (formerly `ExportInfo`) to your Unity scene
2. Add `GltfObject` components to GameObjects you want to export
3. On save, Unity content is converted to glTF format
4. The web application loads these glTF files using Three.js

### Key Features

- **Small file sizes**: < 10MB vs 50-100MB for Unity WebGL
- **Fast load times**: Seconds instead of minutes
- **Direct web integration**: Works with React, Vue, plain HTML
- **Automatic optimization**: Compression and LOD generation

### Animation Support

From the documentation:
- Supports Timeline, Animator (basic states), AnimationClips
- Supports KHR_animation_pointer extension for animating properties
- **No explicit mention of blend shape/morph target details**

## Critical Problem: Three.js Limitation Remains

### The Issue
Since Needle Engine uses **Three.js internally** for rendering, it will have the **SAME LIMITATIONS** as our previous Three.js attempts:

1. **FBX â†’ glTF Conversion**: The FBX model is converted to glTF format
2. **Three.js Rendering**: The glTF is rendered using Three.js
3. **Same Morph Target Problem**: Three.js still cannot access morph targets on certain meshes

### Specific Problem with Tongue Morphs
- The CC_Game_Tongue mesh with Tongue_Tip_Up and Tongue_Curl morphs
- These morphs are likely lost or inaccessible after glTF conversion
- Three.js (and therefore Needle Engine) cannot access them

## Why This Approach Won't Solve Our Problem

The fundamental issue is that:
1. Three.js cannot access certain morph targets on the ActorCore FBX model
2. Needle Engine uses Three.js for rendering
3. Therefore, Needle Engine will have the same limitation

## Alternative Solutions Still Needed

Since Needle Engine won't solve the tongue morph problem, we need to consider:

1. **Pure Unity WebGL** (Heavy but guaranteed to work)
   - All morphs accessible in Unity
   - Direct control over rendering
   - Large file size and slow load times

2. **Custom glTF Export** 
   - Modify the export process to ensure tongue morphs are included
   - Create custom Three.js shaders to access hidden morphs
   - Complex but potentially viable

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use Needle Engine for main avatar
   - Implement tongue animations differently (bones, custom shaders)
   - Compromise on accuracy

4. **Different Avatar Format**
   - Convert ActorCore FBX to a format that preserves all morphs
   - Use Ready Player Me or other avatar systems
   - May lose some specific features

## Conclusion

**Needle Engine is an excellent tool for creating lightweight web experiences from Unity**, but it **does NOT solve our specific problem** with accessing tongue morph targets on the ActorCore FBX model because:

1. It converts FBX to glTF (potential morph loss)
2. It uses Three.js for rendering (same limitations)
3. The problematic morphs remain inaccessible

## Recommendation

Given these findings, if we MUST have the tongue morphs working (DD, NN, RR visemes), we should:

1. **Abandon Needle Engine** for this specific use case
2. **Use standard Unity WebGL** despite its drawbacks
3. **Or find a different avatar system** that works better with web technologies

The user's statement about Needle Engine "completely bypassing Unity WebGL" is accurate, but it doesn't mean it solves the morph target problem - it just uses a different (Three.js-based) approach that has the same fundamental limitation.
