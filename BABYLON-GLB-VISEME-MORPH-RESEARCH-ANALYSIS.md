# Babylon.js GLB Viseme Morph Research Analysis
## Comprehensive Research Findings with Citations

### üîç **CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM BRAVE SEARCH RESEARCH**

## 1. **DOCUMENTED GLB MORPH TARGET MISSING ISSUE**

**Source**: [Babylon.js Forum - GLB Morph Targets Missing (Feb 2023)](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/glb-morph-targets-missing/38074)

**Issue**: ReadyPlayerMe avatars exported as GLB should have 72 morph targets but only 2 appear in Babylon.js
- This directly matches our current problem
- Community confirmed issue with GLB import/export pipeline
- Affects specifically ReadyPlayerMe and ActorCore-style avatars

## 2. **WORKING REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION CONFIRMED**

**Source**: [Babylon.js Forum - ReadyPlayerMe Talking Animation Tutorial (July 2023)](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/readyplayerme-avatar-talking-animation-morph-targets/42387)

**Key Findings**:
- **INDEX-BASED ACCESS PATTERN CONFIRMED**: Working implementation uses `morphTargetManager.getTarget(index)` 
- Bypasses name-matching issues entirely
- Successful multi-mesh coordination (CC_Game_Body + CC_Game_Tongue)
- Live demo: https://viseni.com/readyplayer_talk/

## 3. **ACTORCORE GLB EXPORT ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

**Source**: [Reallusion Feedback - Export animated character in GLB format](https://www.reallusion.com/FeedBackTracker/Issue/Export-animated-character-in-glb-or-glTF-format)
**Source**: [Reallusion Forum - Loss of facial morph data CC4 to UE (Feb 2025)](https://discussions.reallusion.com/t/loss-of-facial-morph-data-when-exporting-from-cc4-to-ue-5-5/13478)

**Critical Issues Identified**:
- **Morph data loss during GLB export** from Character Creator 4
- **Naming convention mismatches** between ActorCore internal names and GLB export
- **Multi-mesh coordination problems** in exported GLB files
- Recent reports (Feb 2025) confirm ongoing issues with facial morph export

## 4. **MULTI-MESH GLB HANDLING PROBLEMS**

**Source**: [Babylon.js Forum - Cannot export mesh to GLB with morph targets and skinning (March 2022)](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/cannot-export-mesh-to-glb-with-both-morph-targets-and-skinning-in-maya-2022/28309/5)

**Technical Issues**:
- GLB format struggles with **multiple meshes having morph targets**
- **Skinning + Morph target combination** causes export/import issues
- Issue was fixed in Maya exporter but similar problems persist in other pipelines

## 5. **BABYLON.JS MORPH TARGET LIMITATIONS**

**Source**: [Babylon.js Forum - Sandbox fails with large numbers of morph targets (Jan 2023)](https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/sandbox-fails-to-play-my-glb-with-large-numbers-of-morph-targets/37642)

**Performance Constraints**:
- Babylon.js has **performance limitations** with high morph target counts
- Large numbers of morph targets can cause sandbox failures
- Suggests need for **selective loading/activation** of morph targets

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Primary Issue**: GLB Export Pipeline Problems
1. **ActorCore to GLB export loses morph data**
2. **Name mapping gets corrupted** during export process
3. **Multi-mesh structure** not properly preserved

### **Secondary Issue**: Babylon.js GLB Loader Limitations
1. **Name-based access fails** due to naming mismatches
2. **Index-based access works** as proven by reference implementation
3. **Multi-mesh coordination** requires specific handling pattern

---

## üîß **PROVEN SOLUTIONS FROM RESEARCH**

### **Solution 1: Index-Based Morph Access (PROVEN)**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented in working reference
- **Method**: Use `morphTargetManager.getTarget(index)` instead of name lookups
- **Evidence**: crazyramirez/readyplayer-talk implementation works successfully

### **Solution 2: Multi-Mesh Index Coordination**
- **Pattern**: Test each mesh independently by index
- **Validation**: Systematically verify which indices produce visible morphs
- **Mapping**: Create index-to-viseme mapping based on visual confirmation

### **Solution 3: GLB Import Verification**
- **Check**: Confirm all expected meshes load (CC_Game_Body, CC_Game_Tongue)
- **Verify**: Morph target count matches expectations per mesh
- **Validate**: Index-based access works for each mesh

---

## üìä **RESEARCH-SUPPORTED TESTING METHODOLOGY**

### **Phase 1: Index Extraction & Validation**
1. Extract all morph target indices from both meshes
2. Log index-to-name mappings for analysis
3. Verify expected mesh structure (CC_Game_Body + CC_Game_Tongue)

### **Phase 2: Systematic Index Testing**
1. Test each morph index individually at high intensity (0.8+)
2. Visual verification of mouth/face movement
3. Mark visible vs non-visible morphs
4. Build working index-to-viseme mapping

### **Phase 3: Viseme Mapping Correction**
1. Map working indices to appropriate visemes
2. Update GLB_VISEME_MAPPINGS with corrected indices
3. Implement index-based viseme system
4. Validate all 15 visemes produce visible movement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **Surface Pro Touch Controls**
- Research confirms touch event handling is critical for Babylon.js
- Smart touch management prevents page zoom while allowing 3D controls
- Canvas-specific event handling required

### **Multi-Mesh Coordination**
- CC_Game_Body handles most facial morphs
- CC_Game_Tongue handles tongue-specific morphs (kk, nn visemes)
- Both meshes must be tested independently

### **Performance Considerations**
- Babylon.js has morph target count limitations
- Index-based access is more performant than name-based
- Reset all morphs before applying new ones (prevents accumulation)

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESEARCH**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete index-based testing interface (‚úÖ DONE)
2. **TEST**: Systematically validate all morph indices
3. **MAP**: Create corrected index-to-viseme mappings
4. **IMPLEMENT**: Update main lip-sync system with index-based access
5. **VALIDATE**: Confirm all 15 visemes work correctly
