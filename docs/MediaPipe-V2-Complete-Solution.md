## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Multi-Layered Loading Strategy

The solution implements a sophisticated loading hierarchy:

1. **Primary**: ES6 Dynamic Import from jsdelivr CDN
2. **Fallback 1**: UMD Bundle from unpkg CDN  
3. **Fallback 2**: Local module loading
4. **Fallback 3**: CPU-only mode with reduced features
5. **Emergency**: Geometric analysis fallback

### Robust Error Handling

```javascript
// Exponential backoff retry with circuit breaker pattern
if (this.retryCount < this.maxRetries) {
    this.retryCount++;
    await this._delay(1000 * Math.pow(2, this.retryCount - 1));
    return await this._initializeInternal();
}
```
