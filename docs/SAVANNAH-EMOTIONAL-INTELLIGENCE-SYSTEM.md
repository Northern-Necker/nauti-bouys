The system balances authentic human-like emotional responses with professional service boundaries, creating engaging yet appropriate interactions.

## 1. Real Bartender Psychology Research

### Professional Engagement Patterns

**Emotional Labor vs. Commercial Friendship**
- Bartenders operate in a unique emotional space where they must balance genuine care with professional boundaries
- **Mixed Motivations**: Flirting and warmth derive from both relational (genuine connection) and instrumental (business) motivations
- **Prior Acquaintance Requirement**: Unlike standard emotional labor, meaningful engagement requires building familiarity over time

**Customer Prioritization Psychology**
- **80/20 Rule**: 80% of revenue comes from 20% of customers (regulars)
- **Selective Attention Mechanics**: Bartenders naturally prioritize based on:
  - Regular customer status
  - Revenue potential  
  - Personal connection quality
  - Reciprocal appreciation
- **Fairness vs. Efficiency Tension**: Must balance treating all customers equally while maintaining business priorities

**Professional Flirtation Boundaries**
- **Controlled Flirtation**: Used as professional tool to create "special atmosphere"
- **Context-Dependent**: Appropriate level varies by customer relationship and setting
- **Management Encouraged**: Indirect encouragement to maintain "appropriate customer feeling"
- **Clear Boundaries**: Professional vs. personal interest must remain distinct

### Emotional Intelligence Components

**Four Core Areas**:
1. **Self-Awareness**: Recognizing own emotional state and limitations
