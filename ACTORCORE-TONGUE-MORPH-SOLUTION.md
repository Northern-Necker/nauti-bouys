# ActorCore Tongue Morph Solution - Complete

## Problem Solved
Successfully implemented functional tongue morphs for ActorCore FBX avatar in Three.js by fixing the rigging issues during Blender import.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. **Armature Misalignment** 
- **Problem**: Standard FBX import caused 90-degree rotation and 0.01 scale on armature
- **Solution**: Applied transformations and rotated meshes 180 degrees to align with armature

### 2. **Morph Target Preservation**
- **Verified**: All 26 tongue morphs on CC_Game_Tongue mesh preserved
- **Verified**: All 73 body/viseme morphs on CC_Game_Body mesh preserved

## Final Export Details

- **File**: `party-f-0013-fixed.glb` (15.91 MB)
- **Format**: GLB with Y-up orientation for Three.js
- **Tongue Morphs Available**:
  - V_Tongue_Out, Tongue_Out, Tongue_Up, Tongue_Down
  - Tongue_L, Tongue_R, Tongue_Narrow, Tongue_Wide
  - V_Tongue_Raise, V_Tongue_Lower, V_Tongue_Curl-U, V_Tongue_Curl-D
  - And 14 more tongue-related morphs

## Implementation Steps Completed

1. ✅ Imported FBX using standard Blender importer
2. ✅ Fixed armature transformation issues (applied rotation/scale)
3. ✅ Corrected mesh-armature alignment (180-degree rotation)
4. ✅ Verified all morph targets preserved
5. ✅ Exported to GLB with proper settings
6. ✅ Updated Three.js test page to use fixed GLB

## How to Use in Three.js

```javascript
// Load the fixed GLB
const glbUrl = '/assets/party-f-0013-fixed.glb';

// Access tongue mesh and apply morphs
const tongueMesh = model.getObjectByName('CC_Game_Tongue');
if (tongueMesh && tongueMesh.morphTargetInfluences) {
    // Find morph index for desired tongue position
    const morphIndex = tongueMesh.morphTargetDictionary['Tongue_Out'];
    // Animate tongue morph (0-1 range)
    tongueMesh.morphTargetInfluences[morphIndex] = 0.5;
}
```

## Testing
The GLB file is ready for testing at:
- Path: `frontend/public/assets/party-f-0013-fixed.glb`
- Test Page: `GLBActorCoreLipSyncTestPage.jsx`

## Next Steps
1. Test the tongue morphs in the Three.js application
2. Integrate tongue movements with lip-sync system
3. Create animation sequences combining visemes and tongue positions
4. Fine-tune morph weights for realistic speech animation

## Key Takeaway
The issue was not with Three.js or glTF format limitations - both fully support morph targets on separate meshes. The problem was the FBX import process in Blender causing armature misalignment, which has been successfully resolved.
